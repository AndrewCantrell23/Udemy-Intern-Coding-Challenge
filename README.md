Udemy Web App Coding Challenge
==============================

My name is Andrew Cantrell and here is my attempt at a quiz taking web app!
* As I am not very accustomed to javascript I followed an online tutorial and then made it customized to how I liked it
* For an extra challenge try to finish the quiz with 100% for an extra little bonus

Functional spec
---------------

Please implement a quiz-taking system.

* The system should be a full-stack web application.
  * It should have a backend API to get the questions.
  * And a frontend UI to answer them.
* The quiz consists of one or more questions.
* The quiz only has multiple-choice questions.
* The app should tell the user how he did at the end of the quiz.


Documentation
-------------

Full working quiz

* Description of the problem and solution.
* Whether the solution focuses on back-end, front-end or if it's full stack.
* Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural. 
* Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
* Link to to the hosted application where applicable.

How we review
-------------

Your application will be reviewed by our engineers. We do take into consideration your experience level.

**We value quality over feature-completeness**. It is fine to leave things aside provided you call them out in your project's README. The code should be as close to production-ready as possible

The aspects of your code we will assess include:

* **Correctness**: does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
* **Architecture**: does the application handle requests and data efficiently? Is the code structured in a reusable and easily adaptable way?
* **Code quality**: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?  Are there any code smells or other red flags? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
* **Testing**: do you have some unit and some integration tests?
* **Technical choices**: do choices of libraries, databases, architecture etc. seem appropriate for the chosen application?
